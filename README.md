# Huffman Code

This repository contains an implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in C++. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that is commonly used for file compression. This implementation builds a Huffman tree, encodes a given input string, and decodes the encoded string.

## Introduction

The `huffman.cpp` file in this repository contains the source code for the Huffman coding algorithm. It defines various functions and data structures required for building the Huffman tree, encoding a string, and decoding an encoded string. The code utilizes the C++11 standard features.

## Usage

To use the Huffman code implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `huffman.cpp` file in a C++ compiler of your choice.
3. Modify the code as needed or provide input strings to the `buildHuffmanTree` function.
4. Compile and run the code.
5. The program will display the Huffman codes for each character in the input string, the original input string, the encoded string, and the decoded string.

## Execution in Dev C++

If you want to execute the code in Dev C++ and ensure compatibility with the C++11 standard, follow these steps:

1. Open Dev C++ and create a new empty project.
2. Copy the contents of the `huffman.cpp` file and paste it into a new source file in the project.
3. Go to the "Compiler Options" or "Project Options" in Dev C++.
4. In the "Parameters" or "Additional Parameters" section, add the `-std=c++11` flag.
5. Save the changes and build the project.
6. Run the compiled executable.

Ensure that you have the Dev C++ IDE configured properly to compile and execute C++ programs. Make sure to save the modified code file and update the compiler options to include the `-std=c++11` flag. This flag enables C++11 features, which are required for the code to compile and run successfully.
